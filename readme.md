#### Motivation
Dual-phase liquid xenon time projection chambers are currently dominating the direct search for WIMP dark matter in the range from $1\,\mathrm{GeV}$ to $1\,\mathrm{TeV}$.
The next-generation detector DARWIN will probe the entire accessible WIMP parameter space - only being limited by irreducible neutrino interactions.
This challenging sensitivity goal can only be achieved through an unprecedentedly large exposure and low background levels.


#### Signal Formation Simulation
The SFS software library provides a lightweight ``Python3`` framework for the ``NEST`` library to simulate the signal formation process in a liquid xenon time projection chamber.
This allows us to systematically compare different detector designs and assess their impact on the experiment's sensitivity in a top-down approach.


#### Documentation
Installation and use are documented and showcased in ``sfs.ipynb``.
Therein, my thesis work is exemplarily reproduced.
Please note that the project is actively being worked on; accordingly, key features are still being implemented.
In case of any questions, feel free to contact me.


The idea is to develop a lightweight and easy-to-use tool for the top-down how affects the performance of the next-generation dark matter detector.
The code is based on the Noble Element Simulation Technique (NEST).
