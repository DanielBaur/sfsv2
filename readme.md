#### Motivation
Dual-phase liquid xenon time projection chambers are currently dominating the direct search for WIMP dark matter in the range from $1GeV$ to $1\mathrm{TeV}$.
The next-generation detector DARWIN will probe the entire accessible WIMP parameter space - only being limited by irreducible neutrino interactions.
This challenging sensitivity goal can only be achieved through an unprecedentedly large exposure and low background levels.

#### Signal Formation Simulation
SFS is a ``Python3`` software library providing a lightweight framework for the [``NEST``](https://nest.physics.ucdavis.edu/) package to simulate the signal formation process in a liquid xenon time projection chamber.
This allows us to systematically compare different detector designs and assess their impact on the experiment's sensitivity in a top-down approach.

#### Documentation
For documentation please refer to ``sfs.ipynb`` in which installation and use are described and showcased.
Therein, my thesis work is exemplarily reproduced.
Please note that the project is actively being worked on; accordingly, key features are still being implemented.
In case of any questions, feel free to reach out.
